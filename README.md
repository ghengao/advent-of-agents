# Advent of Agent

This is a casual learning project focus on building AI agent with Google's ADK (Agent Development Kit). It mainly follows learning path from https://adventofagents.com/ but maybe supplemented with other topics to dig deeper into certain areas. The goal is to build a solid understanding of how to build AI agents using ADK and how to make them work in production environment, but most importantly, to have fun along the way!
